## Features

- **Real-time Cursor Tracking**: The application accurately tracks the position of the cursor as it moves across the webpage. The x and y coordinates are displayed in a visually appealing way, allowing you to observe the cursor's path.

- **Key Press Tracking**: CursorEventInsights records key presses in real-time. The pressed key's name is immediately displayed, providing insight into user interactions beyond just cursor movements.

- **Mouse Click Detection**: The application also captures mouse clicks, displaying a message when a click event is detected. This information can be valuable for understanding user engagement and interaction patterns.

- **Time Analysis**: CursorEventInsights includes a timer that measures the time spent at a specific cursor position. This data helps you identify points of interest or engagement on your webpage.

## Getting Started

To use CursorEventInsights on your webpage, follow these steps:

1. Include the provided JavaScript code in your HTML file. This code snippet listens for cursor movements, key presses, and mouse clicks, updating the display accordingly.

2. Add HTML elements to your webpage to display the cursor position, key presses, and timer information. You can use the provided class names to target these elements.

3. Customize the appearance of the displayed information through CSS styling as needed.

## Usage

1. The cursor position is displayed as the cursor moves across the webpage. The x and y coordinates are shown visually, making it easy to understand the cursor's path.

2. Key presses are tracked in real-time, and the pressed key's name is displayed. This allows you to analyze user interactions beyond cursor movements.

3. Mouse clicks trigger a message to be displayed, helping you observe user engagement patterns.

4. The timer starts measuring the time spent at a specific cursor position when the cursor remains stationary. This can provide insights into user engagement and interest.
